## What's your quote of the day?
```javascript
function quoteOfTheDay() {
    const quotes = [
        "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.",
        "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.",
        "With each new dawn, we have the chance to start again.",
        "Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes it meaningful.",
        "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions."
    ];

    return quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)];
}
console.log(quoteOfTheDay());
